This program has the capabilites to see how a liquid would flow through an object by opening specific pieces of the object, kind of like opening pieces of a grid. The grid, or object, will percolate if the liquid is able to flow from the top to the bottom.

Through the InteractivePercolationVisualizer.java, you can choose the size of the grid you will work with and then you will click pieces of the grid which will open them. You will be able to see if the object percolates by a tracker on the bottom left.

There is also the PercolationVisualizer.java file that will alow you to use one of the many different examples of premade percolation sets. This will go through the grid automatically and check to see if the object will percolate based upon the inputted spots to open from the inputted file.

Lastly, there is the PercolationStats.java which tracks to see the different statistics, such as the mean and standard deviation, of how much of the grid will need to be opened in order for it to percolate.

This project uses a weighted quick union algorithm which keeps the time complexitiy low compared to other algorithms, such as normal quick union.
